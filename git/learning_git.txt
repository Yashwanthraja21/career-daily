"Git" is an version control sytem

"Version control" is a tool that tracks, manages, and records different versions of files in a special database called a repository.
 
"Repository" stores the file. It act like an database. 


Ex: "Rough_draft.pdf" --> "Rough_draft_v2.pdf"('Some_changes' are made at Rough_draft and save) --> ""Rough_draftv3.pdf"('some changes' are made at "Rough_draft_v2" and save)

So if need to use "Rough_draft_v2.pdf" i can use it with the help of version control system because the version control system hold's the changes made. So when ever it's required we can "Rollback".
